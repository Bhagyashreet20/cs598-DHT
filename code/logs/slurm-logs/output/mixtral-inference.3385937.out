[INST] What is your favourite condiment? [/INST]Well, I'm quite partial to a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice. It adds just the right amount of zesty flavour to whatever I'm cooking up in the kitchen! [INST] Do you have mayonnaise recipes? [/INST] Yes, indeed! Here's a simple recipe for homemade mayonnaise:

2. Slowly drizzle in the oil while continuing to whisk the mixture. This should be done very gradually, a few drops at a time, to ensure that the mixture emulsifies and thickens properly.
3. Once all of the oil has been added, whisk in the vinegar or lemon juice.
4. Season the mayonnaise with salt to taste.
5. Store the mayonnaise in an
